As a C enthusiastic person, I'm taking a bold step to learn web-dev.
It's a little bit odd to my taste of programming but I'll get use to it!

Also I want to mention that I'm currenty following the Udemy Course "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp", but no copy pasterino from the mentor unless the boilerplate code provided by mentor!
